<h1>EXTREMELY<br>SERIOUSLY</h1>
<p>Winter Walking is North America's leading manufacturer of industrial ice cleats and winter traction gear. We've been helping the world's largest organizations to reduce their employee slips and falls for over 30 years. We've been around for while, but you won't find us on Amazon or in Wal-Mart because that's not where corporate safety professionals spend their time.</p>

<h3>INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH</h3>
<p>We do not build our ice cleats for casual use on the weekend. Our products are not meant for walking the dog or shoveling the driveway. <em>We build our ice cleats to be industrial strength because they are used in industrial settings</em>. Our ice cleats are designed to hold up in the most rugged of all working conditions. We understand that a worker whose job task requires them to deal with ice and snow for hours at a time, day after day, week after week cannot risk using an ice cleat that may break after a few hours or days. We build our ice cleats to last all season long, year in and year out. We don't just make ice cleats, we perfect them.&#8482;</p>

<h3>INNOVATION</h3>
<p>We have the webs largest selection of unique ice walking items. Sure there are sites with more items, but take a closer look and you'll see a lot of the same thing over and over again. Every ice cleat that Winter Walking offers was custom designed and manufactured by us. We hold a dozen patents on various things from spike placement, to self cleaning treads and from replaceable straps to rear pull-tabs. But the best part is that each one of these concepts sprang from our intense interaction with you, our customer.</p>

<h3>MORE THAN JUST PRODUCTS</h3>
<p>Quite possibly you came to this site looking for ice cleats, but in all reality, nobody really <em>wants</em>ice cleats. What you really wanted was to make your slips and falls go away. Here at Winter Walking, rest assured that we will put your employees in the best possible ice cleat for their unique situation, but that's only the beginning. We will stick around to help you implement your program, promote it and monitor its success. From customized training posters and product specific videos to customized web portals and extensive field surveys, we will help you to get what you <em>really</em> wanted from us&#8230;a long term reduction of slips and falls.</p>

<h3>CALL US and WE'LL BE HERE</h3>
<p>We prepare for the Winter by building a massive inventory to help meet your demands when you need it the most. Summers around here can be lonely because our customers only call us when it's snowing, but 99% of our orders ship within 24 hours because we've spent all that time preparing&#8230;and just waiting for you to call.</p>
