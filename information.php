				<h1>Every Step We Take...</h1>
				<p>With every step your employees take, they are exposed to the risk of slipping and falling. The more they walk, the more they are exposed. Additionally, slippery conditions such as ice, snow, oils, grease and even rain substantially increase that risk. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly <span class="bold">15% off all lost workday accidents are due to slips, trips and falls.</span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h1>$34,000 Per Slip and Fall</h1>
				<p>The National Safety Council publishes annual figures on lost workdays. Their figures take into account both direct and indirect costs. According to their 2005-2006 figures, the current total cost for each lost workday is a whopping $34,000!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h1>Enormous Effect to the Bottom Line</h1>
				<p>Annually, most companies will see <span class="bold">between 2%-5%</span> of their workforce experience lost workdays due to accidental slips and falls. At a rate of $34,000 per accident, these costs mount quickly and have a dramatic effect on the businesses bottom line.</p>
				<p>For over 30 years, Winter Walking has specialized in the reduction of workplace slips and falls through the implementation of All-Traction™ Footwear, including ice cleats and indoor footwear. From manufacturing facilities to service and delivery personnel, Winter Walking has been helping to keep working professionals on their feet and doing their jobs.</p>

				<h1>THE ICEBERG EFFECT</h1>
				<p>Many companies track the cost of these accidents by tracking things such as workers’ compensation claims and medical costs. These costs, known as “direct costs,” are easy to track.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, the direct costs do not represent the whole picture. “Indirect costs” such as lost productivity, replacement hiring and additional training are much harder to track and actually have a much larger financial impact. Often, the indirect costs can be as much as 10 times that of the direct costs.</p>

				<p class="direct">Direct costs such as:</p>
			<ul class="iceberg">
				<li>Workers’ compensation</li>
				<li>Medical costs, etc.</li>
			</ul>
				<p class="direct">Indirect costs such as:</p>
			<ul class="iceberg">
				<li>Lost/decreased productivity</li>
				<li>Administrative costs</li>
				<li>Overtime pay</li>
				<li>Replacement hiring</li>
				<li>Managerial costs</li>
				<li>Employee morale</li>
				<li>Slowed work pace due to other employees fear of injury</li>
